                <p>I made this site to share what I am feeling. It lets me open up in a way a card never could and gives me the space to say everything on my mind. Maybe this is a little cheesy, but I hope you like it.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-section">
                    <p>It has been really hard without you. I took a few days off this week just to sit with my emotions and build this site, complete with a flower animation I coded for hours. It will probably look nicer on your MacBook than on a phone but I hope it still brings a smile.</p>

                    <p><strong>First and most important, I am so deeply sorry for the pain I caused you by betraying your trust.</strong> There's no excuse for what I did. You didn't deserve that, not even for a second.
                    You've been the only person on my mind every single day, and even with all my flaws, I always tried to show up for you and be there however I could.
                    I know I broke something precious between us, and I just want you to know how much I regret it, and how much I still love you.</p>

                        <p><strong>You make it so easy to be myself</strong></p>
                        <p>With you, I never have to pretend. I can be goofy, anxious, tired, over the top, or completely quiet and you never made me feel like I was too much. You saw all the versions of me and somehow you still stayed. That kind of safety and acceptance is something I've never felt with anyone else.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="love-reason">
                        <p><strong>You turn the simplest moments into core memories</strong></p>
                        <p>Whether we're just yapping for hours, watching something dumb, or walking somewhere without a plan, you make it feel meaningful. You somehow turn every day into comfort and even silence into warmth. Life feels softer with you in it.</p>

                        <p>You're not afraid to speak your mind, especially when it comes to feelings, and I needed that. You've called me out when I was emotionally closed off, but never in a way that made me shut down. You make me want to grow, not just for you but for myself too. That's rare and it means everything.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>The way you care about your friends and your family is genuine and full of heart. You check in, you listen, you show up. And the love they have for you in return says so much. Watching how you treat the people you care about has only made me admire you more. Your heart is huge and it's real.</p>

                        <p>When you found out about the whole DUI situation, I honestly expected things to shift, for you to see me differently or pull away. But you didn't. You still treated me with the same warmth and care, like that part of my past didn't erase the rest of me. That kind of quiet acceptance hit deep. Being around you felt safe, not because you overlooked it, but because you saw it and stayed anyway</p>

                                <p>I've spent the night recording and editing a video together with me yapping and my favorite memories with you.</p>
                                
                                <p>It was supposed to be right here but I decided not to upload it. Maybe because I didn't want to seem too desperate or something, I don't know.</p>
                                
                                <p>The idea was to drop this off Monday morning with a bottle of champagne and some orange juice and be like, have a mimosa while you're reading and watching all of this. But you said you won't be here Monday morning.</p>
                                
                                <p>So I'm just dropping this off Monday night instead.</p>
                                
                                <p>The plan was also to mention I'd be spending the day at Coffee Reveille if you wanted to say hi. I still spent the day there, just didn't end up dropping this off till the night. I really wanted to grab lunch with you today.</p>
                                
                                <p>Anywayyyys, maybe it's best you don't see the video haha. It's just me yapping for almost an hour sharing a bit more in detail how I felt. Maybe I'll update this page with the video without telling you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
                                
                                <p>I'm sitting in my car next to Gus writing this at 9PM eating McDonald's, about to drop this outside your door. Hopefully you're home :)</p>
                                
                                <p>Hope you and Hennus are doing good.</p>
