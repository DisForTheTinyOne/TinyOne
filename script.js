        went to the office this morning to grab lunch with some higher ups to celebrate my release.

        i then walked in the city towards my house and saw this funny poster about alex hehe. got about 15k steps at lunch

        got home and worked some more while obviously still walking. i then decided to walk to target and back

        i got GRILLED. i forgot sunscreen again and i am soooo red now not good not good

        ate some panda express healthy option aka green lettuce and chicken thats it lol

        i got a ollipop new flavor which was good and then got a funny lil fortune cookie msg :)

        target also revamped slightly and things are in STOCK. sooo many thingies for the movies we used to bring

        all types of lil snackies for the tiny one was kinda tempted to get some

        walked on my way home too and saw my building from alll the way from target 

        also new flavor unlocked with lacroix aka mojito its alright

        so now im back on the treadmill grinding my steps and grinding my work

        bout to hop off and go workout for bout 30 mins before showering and crashing hopefully by 1am

        i also think today reach 10k words!! wew

        walked so much make me overthink way too much as well and made me miss the tiny one a lot. probably gonna drop off some flowers thursday or friday. pretty much when it'll mark 2 weeks since last time i kissed the tiny one goodbye while she was on the pooper

        really want to go the outside lands with her cause i feel like last time we didnt get the full experience of side quests so was hoping this year we'd make up for it

        anyways today felt pretty sad so i'm gonna go pump some iron before i overthink again

        today is national girlfriend day! i was still planning on dropping flowers at the door but not sure if youre home

        you did say you might be at lollapalooza this weekend so im not gonna risk it. i'll drop them when youre home at some point cause tiny one must always have flowers

        anyways i didn't get the chance to get a haircut today cause work has been busy and we're launching something i've been working on next monday so i've been prepping for it

        also only gonna go to hard summer for a single day and be back sunday cause i need to grind out work and make sure we are good to go

        otherwise not much else today. I just got home, didn't have plans to go home but my car had only a few miles left

        so i put my car on charge near my apartment and took the caltrain to my bros, it was only a 25mins commute which was a vibe.

        i ate steak and then i pooped so im good to go for a long car ride. i'm packed and everything and i wanna get there by 1am so im outie

        i'll be back sunday so no updates tmrw. also walking to caltrain reminded me of that one time where i got all wet near the sprinklers

        oki bye love you

        i'm gonna keep it really really short today cause i need to wake up early tomorrow to start work really early

        today i wrapped up work around 6pm cause i went on a 45 minutes walk. i kinda liked the tan i got at half moon bay

        so i went to target during lunch for chipotle and grabbed a few things including tanning oil hehe

        it was REALLY sunny today so i went on a 45 minutes walk today shirtless and oiled up in very non crowded street

        im rdy to look tan! also reason im waking up early tmrw is i wanna get a workout in before work.

        i couldn't really figure out whati wanted to do this weekend so couple hours ago i bought a single hard summer ticket on huge discount

        i'll stay maybe 2 days if im feeling it but i think one day is enough cause outside lands is next weekend

        gotta get my haircut tmrw at 4:30pm, grab dinner with my bro and peace out straight to LA driving

        prob gonna do a midday update tmrw, but won't bring my laptop to LA so prob no updates for a day or 2 after that.

        okiii bye bye buttherfly

        oh yeah the dog is hennus but i have him animated for the lil project

        it is 11:56pm right now and i just moved from the treadmill to the couch to write this out before showering and sleeping
        
        don't have much to say today. worked till 5pm and then walked to the greek place to grab a chicken gyro wrap
        
        SOOO good
        
        i then walked by that shuryuken place we went once for all you can eat. they closed down for a couple months a couple months ago
        
        looks like they finally opened up and the place is PACKED. there a bigass line out the door im not sure i want to wait but wonder what they changed
        
        came back home ate food watched tiktoks and then back on the treadmill working on the lil thingy. not sure when i'll share it
        
        maybe when i reach 10,000 words of yappin? possibly
        
        i gave a couple more applications to different places for cat fostering, kinda cant wait cause i spent most of my week home just vibin
        
        i retired by card tricks cause im already a pro and got a cool trick under my sleeve
        
        i think my next little hobby for a few days is music producing. gonna produce one banger and retire as well
        
        still debating which software to use.
        
        i went on a late 10pm walk to grab a whiteclaw just to go thru my thoughts and was tired at home. SOOO many food trucks everywhere it is wild
        
        came back home and opened a bubly. new bubly flavor unlocked aka coconut pineapple. its ight
        
        that was my day! tomorrow i got no plans so same old same old, prob gonna start the music thingy.
        
        that enough for today, I’ll meet myself again tomorrow

        today i decided to take half day off past noon. i had my morning meetings and kinda tapped out at lunch.
        
        i skipped lunch and decided to go out and drove all the way to half moon bay. i really wanted some air and just walk by the coast thinking about things so it felt nice
        
        went to a beach and walked around a bunch saw so many animals. so many bunnies, chickies, big chickies, hungry chickies, and goffers i think
        
        i caught video of a goffer who was hungie hungie and wasn't really afraid of me he a cutie lil guy
        
        i got 25k ish steps in, got the worse rash ever on my thigh from my undies scrubbin my leg so finally sat down and ate my first meal
        
        its this lil famous sam's clam chowder spot. got meself an afternoon beer :) clam chowder and lobster roll
        
        then drove my ass back home and now back on the couch typing this out. i also fixed a few issues with this site including some buttons stopped working, and video thumbnails not properly showing
        
        i'm going to spend some time today to learn something more difficult with cards and probably upload it later tonight
        
        okiiii im back for the nightly update! didnt do much since my last update other than learn a new trick, eat subway and then record my new trick :)
        
        i'm also grilled rip my face and neck and arms are red even tho i put sunscreen on at home but i guess i shouldve brought it and re-applied
        
        it was sooo gloomy today but thats the most dangerous one
        
        im in bed already at 935pm and just gotta watch youtube or something for a couple hours

        i just had my final work presentation and things went really good so i can finally breath and not stress
        
        definitely still feeling tired cause i didnt sleep much today stressin a bit and also still feeling a bit sick and overheating
        
        but starting next week im gonna be able to focus on my lil side project and also get some sleep and take work slowly
        
        i'm currently on the couch drinking my whiteclaw and just had my first meal of the day aka subway :) the properly made one!
        
        i'm thinking of selling my tiesto ticket for $80 more than i bought it for yesterday. including uber and everything i feel like it'll save me like $150+ not going
        
        also going there at 6pm feels to early and i just want to rest up a bit so i'll prob do that for now
        
        this is my midday update. i'll update again later
        
        I IS BACK THE NEXT DAYYYY
        
        not good little one not good. i ended up going to dreamstate instead and got so fkd up
        
        i woke up at like 2pm and just laid in bed till now, finally making coffee
        
        i pregamed a bit too hard and ended up also doing tesla later at night so i stay'd up on my couch till like 6am
        
        i had no idea dreamstate was going till 3am jesus. also it was SOOO packed when i got there at like 11, but it was pretty empty at 3am
        
        i think the older crowd cant handle them hours. just ate some greek food and i think im just gonna game for a bit
        
        i want to go out today again so ill see what is happeningx tonight. not gonna do an update on today until tomorrow cause nothing really happened yet for a mid day update

        i think i drank too much yesterday so im just being a potato today. i feel like my tolerance went way down i get fkd up way faster now
        
        i genuinely dont feel like going today but i think it is too late to sell the ticket

        im going to pay some people to get me some assets for the thing im working so will have to figure that out tomorrow

        okiiii it is currently 5pm as im writing this and doing a mid day update! 

        i made a couple minor changes! each flower is a different color and randomizes everyday using the date as part of algorithm hehe. also switching date tabs will now scroll to the top of the text. thats it im too focused on the lil thingy
        
        im probably going to the illenium show today since i have the ticket but im considering selling it if i manage to sell it last minute
        
        the ticket is going for $250 which is over double the price i paid so if i manage to sell it then i gotta find something else to do
        
        but i really want to get out of the house lol this is not good. at least i got another 25k steps in and its only 5pm im on pace to beat all my records. it is also kinda cheating cause i walked 2 hours last night past midnight so it got added to today
        
        not gonna keep it too long cause i wanna find a way to sell this ticket asap!
        
        today i worked only for bout 4 hours, then spent another couple hours on the lil thing im working for this site
        
        its turning out even more cheesier than i expected but im loving it. the logic is all pretty much setup, just need to work on the assets and visuals
        
        also i got my shoes today! im still kinda keep my old ones have wear them for random walks and festivals and stuff
        
        also today i got a new favorite bubly flavor. they kinda copied my strat with combining a bunch of existing bubly flavors into one. it literally tastes what i made a few times
        
        other than that not much else happened. grinded last night till 2am, and woke up at 10am for a meeting
        
        im drinking my second cup of coffee right now as im typing this and waiting for my subway order to be complete before i pick it up
        
        might also have to get some alcohol if imma be pregraming to illenium or something
        
        okiii thats it for now, i'll either update later tonight or tmrw morning
        
        ... the flowers are cute today :)

        also looks like there is nasty bug on mobile when you switch tabs. i was playing around and noticed that switching tabs kinda fks up the layout of the screen. i think i fixed it but wont know until i update this site
        
        its 11am and im still in bed. window open, dark room and mcdonalds. no reason to leave my bed
        
        i ended up selling my ticket and going to midway for don diablo. ngl he was not too great. i was pregraming and listening to all his bangers, but he did not play any of them
        
        its crazy it felt like the whole city was at illenium, midway was like half empty
        
        i dont know if i cant type for too long, im so tired and just wanna crash and nap some more.
        
        i did end up setting up a few bots to snag an illenium ticket for cheap today. they pretty much just refresh each re-seller website every 30 seconds until it finds a price below $150 and then itll ping me
        
        im typing this out with half an eye ball open. im soo eepy eepy.
        
        also today is the last day the tiny one is not in the bay unless plans changed
        
        i woke up feeling really sad today likely cause i miss her so much. i dont think ill be on my screen today. i just wanna rest for a bit

i won't write too much tonight since i've been deep in prototype land for the next little thing i'm uploading here. i've spent like 3 or 4 hours this evening just messing around, testing ideas, throwing spaghetti at the wall, and i think i finally landed on something

not sleepy at all and motivation is still high so i'm gonna keep pushing for a bit and get started on the one i picked.

there's still a bunch of stuff to do so who knows when it'll be done but i KNOOOOW it'll be super cheesy and dumb but whatever im having fun working on it

also took pics of all the prototypes and added them to today's memories. tiny one's not gonna know which one i picked till she sees it

anyway food update. ate my last meal prepped meal today aka the fifth one of the week. and then i ordered chipotle and saw i had a 40 percent discount and also a free bowl on orders above 20

so i ended up ordering double protein chicken and then got a second free bowl and then got a 40 percent discount on top. so i got 2 meals for like 18 bucks

i've kinda just worked all day today from 8am to like 6pm. took a little break, ate food, and then went back on the treadmill and just worked on these ideas till now. taking a little break on the couch because my legs are so tired and now writing this, uploading pics, and all that good stuff

after this imma be back working on them prototypes

i also got a call back earlier today about the fostering cats. apparently they only have a mama cat and a few kittens and i feel like that'll be way too much work. i'll probably check out a few more places next week and maybe go in person

also thinking about taking monday off because these past couple weeks at work have been a lot with on call and this project. i haven't seen anyone since wobbleland last saturday oops

my new shoes are also arriving tomorrow so i'm pumped for that

uhhh what else what else ohhh yeah i found one of my airpods today. i was doing laundry and it ended up being in the pocket of some dirty pants so that saves me a bunch of moni

okiiiii that's it for the big one for day 12
hope tiny one is doing good

oops still ended up writing around 500 words, my legs needed a break

also spent the morning fixing up my couch i was already sweaty at 8am

back to the treadmill i go...

day 11 of late night yappin

and i've added a total word count too! 6000 words of yaps goddamn

it is 11:15pm rn and still on my treadmill getting my last few steps in. i've really been living in my living room this week

i did do a bunch of little tweaks here and there on this lil site. stuff like improving spacing, removing "Click on any date tab to read that day's thoughts" to accomodate the xtra space the total word count takes.

pretty much touched every single page in some way. adding extra gradients here and there, adding more character to some section and obviously cant forget the emojis!

also the flower at the start will be a random color everyday. it is biased towards lighter colors tho so no poop color or anything like that at least less likely. but for day 1 i cheated and made them pink!

anyways!! work meeting went really well today im kinda balling. i was stressi but things worked out and had some help from my manager who is also a beast

i did wrap up work a 4pm today and finally had lunch aka first meal of the day aka salmon and rice hehe. side note i do miss the old couch format felt like it was special

it is also funny i havent worked in my office for like the past 5 days ive literally been living in my living room usually on the walk pad

i dont think i mentioned but earlier on monday i had to move the lil christmas star the tiny one gave me from the fake monstera to the fridge. secured with 2 magnets! so for sure it wont fall

cause my pad and mini desk is facing the tree, the lil star was always in my vision and it just wasnt good for my mental health. the day i had 35k steps i kept looking at it and sadness always hit me so not good not good

i think it really looks good on the fridge tho, i kinda look at it more often since it is right there when i go to the fridge. mostly to get my leftover subway sandwich 

speaking of subway i ordered subway today. i didnt want to eat salmon and rice for 4 meals in a row so had to break it up with a lil sammich

im so close to get the "captain" level of subway rewards program which is where you spend $200 in a year. i get free chips every friday with my sandwich so i know what im eating every friday

anyways after i wrapped up work at 4pm, i had lunch and then worked on this site for a bit. I think i'm done with doing minor little design updates (maybe some minor ones here and there). but i have a couple ideas which require more efforts and will take a fews days

i feel like there isn't much else to tweak unless for the sake of change, but im pretty happy how things are looking

i also talked with Yash for a couple hours on facetime for our business. they are like way ahead but i told them ill start working with them in a couple weeks. they have a whole business deck already preppred up to get VC money just need to get a really good prototype working

other than thaaaaat i went on a late night walk... it sucks without airpods aka i havent found any of my airpods and ive looked EVERYWHERE. so i think ill buy a new sets again cause replacement buds at like $80 (which i need 2) and brand new airpods are $160. but alsooooo i feel like in a couple months when apple unveils their new iphone and products, they are due to release airpods pro 3.

im like should i waiiiit but surviving without airpods for a whole 2 months is hard

todays been really busy! been grinding at work on this new project, aka the meeting i was kinda scared off last week. so now i kicked off writing the docs before implementation. feels kinda nice to be ahead of things for once

got a meeting with my manager and the customers tomorrow afternoon to go over it and see if i get approval so been bustin me booty today. will also wake up early ish tomorrow to start working again... and walking on the pad too!

i got a goal of getting 20k steps a day during work days. and i hit it today! so about 3-4 hours of walking a day aka 10 miles. walking also makes me focus more so definitely helping

for food today i ate 2 of my prepped meals oops so i had salmon rice and veggies for both lunch and dinner. i did some calculations and each meal is 398 calories and 49g of protein. which is wild that i only ate about 800 calories... + the last can of pringles which is 100 calories. might reward myself with something fancier this weekend if i keep this up

surviving on 900 rn and kinda starving but all is good

next step is consistently working out but thats prob starting next week, one step at a time to losing this fatass. baby steps

after working till bout 7 ish and then eating. i lost my 2nd and only airpod so now both are lost somewhere around my apartment

ive spent like 10mins looking thru everything and finally gave in and destroyed my couch... still didnt find it rip. couch currently in pieces

the couch is still dissassembled so gotta deal with that tomorrow. maybe it'll magically appear once i stop caring

i also finally fixed the light under my bed! been like 2-3months thats been busted go happy with that

today was a productive day but still feels like something is missing

didnt do any updates to this website today, but im thinking of cleaning this up after my meeting tomorrow cause i dont think ill be working after that aka 4pm so ill spend a bit maybe redesigning some stuff. creative chill mode sounds kinda perfect after all this hustle

hope the tiny one is enjoying her time! i think this time around little one is in japan with the parents so should definitely be fun. bet she's eating good

my brother is leaving tomorrow to netherlands to visit his good friends he is also bringing the kiddos for a week so they'll have fun. family adventures everywhere lately

okiiiii i think that is is it for today. sleepy brain slowly taking over

peace out! bed time calls`,

        today was a chill day. i woke up in the morning not feeling too great mentally mostly sad for some reason
        
        i woke up at around 7 so i decided to hit the gym for the first time in a while, i also did get a few steps in on the treadmill
        
        im also stressing a bit about work and this new work project... not to sure where to start with it
        
        i think today ill keep it light, ill probably complete this daily update tomorrow morning.
        
        it is currently 12:50am and i am so tired and a bit stressi.
        
        i did actually meal prep today. i somehow found the will power to go to target and get some cooking done
        
        otherwise nothing much happened today. i was just chilling and watching youtube. im considering starting the new season of love island cause i keep seing it on my tiktok feed
        
        i just wanna watch something and turn my brain off cause i dont want to think about anything
        
        anyways thats it for today i think. tomorrow im getting my new shoes delivered so im pumped.
        
        im also getting the extension cord i need to get my sensor + light under the bed workng again. its been like 2 months its been busted so need get productive and fix shiet up
        
        im signing off for now, i need to go to sleep. my teeth brushed, background music is on, window is open, and fresh tshirt one. time to eep`,

today i think will be the shortest one!

im in bed it is 1130 and im so tired... i think going out these past 2 days messed me up real good. i wanted to meal prep and go out and eat but instead i was just rotting and watching movies

I ended up watching social network and the very first avengers. i also gamed from 9pm to 11pm with my buddies

nothing too productive today but i did get quesadilla from the food truck it was really good

ive actually ended up editing the video i recorded of myself yappin and trying out the merch but i had to remove about 50% of the footage. it was wayyyy too cringy hehe

also one of the picture i finally shaved the little patch i had on my chin so i obivously had to take a pic and upload it to this site

other than that nothing interesting happened today. felt pretty lonaly today tbh but im going into this week pretty refreshed

im just really eepy today so not a lot of typing, but the edited video should make up for it (horribly edited btw) and also very drunk`,

i just woke up it is 10am and i came back home at around 1am

i left 30 mins before the end but i think today i enjoyed the music more

i think today this morning i wont type as much cause i am sooooo tired and eepy so might crash again after typing this one out

yesterday during the day i got out of bed at like 1pm after my nap. i ordered mcdonalds aka 2 double cheese burgers and started cleaning up my place a bit. i also finally changed my sheets so i am not laying on squeaky clean sheets

i went earlier to cow palace yesterday at around 6pm and decided to wander around the parking lot. the pregame culture for cow palace is wild hahah like people come in early park and there were soooo many people in the lot pregaming. while walking few people offered to drink with them but i was in my zone and already kinda drunk so didn't join anyone.

i did manage to come out of the parking lot with a free buzzball so ill take it

today instead of the anyma hoodie i wore a "barely alive" jersey that i got for the tiny one. i got it in large cause i feel jerseys always gotta be big. so now i got the stinkiness on it

it was funny wearing jersey cause while walking around cow palace i probably saw 10 other people wearing the jersey and they'd always smile back. unintentionally matching

i was also going thru my pictures and i saw i took a 3 minutes video of me trying out the merch when i came back home friday night at like 1 am. that footage is never seeing light... maybe

i was sooooo drunk and doing my voice as if i was talking to the tiny one

that will not be publicly avaiable

side note i just ordered greek food while im in bed. the place is like 2 blocks away but im getting it delivered cause my fatass is too lazy and im too cozy in my undies in bed. as usual the bedroom is cold, in my fresh sheets under all the blankies im good im not going outside

anywayyys it felt like yesterdays music was much better. i went to the floor when crankdat came up jesus the floor was PACKED. it was sooo hot with no ventilation

people were also rude with no one saying excuse me or anything as they were pushing around. i think the hard base/dubstep crowd is a bit different from what i usually go for

so obviously i ended up going back in the bleachers and vibed there

i only got 1 wine box thingy during the night from my favorite bartender (it was the same people from last night in the vip section) and they recognized me and talked about the jersey i was wearing. it was really cute but i did not get a discount this time rip

i thiiink thats it for yesterdays day. im in bed and food is delivered in the lobby so i gotta put some clothes on. im typing this one with only 1 eye ball open cause im soooo eepy

i got no plans for today so im going to eat and prob nap again. i think for dinner im going to go on a solo date aka pick a random place in my neighborhood and do a sit down

ill do another update on todays day around midnight

i think my friends are free to game tn so thats the plan otherwise i think im just going to rot

also i did a minor update on this page! ive added a little bar underneath the header with the same gradient. also cleaned up some spacing around this page

i've added a word count to each day! damn it's really already been 3000ish words of me yappin late night

i don't know if the tiny one even reads any of this, but i've also added a 2nd button at the end of the last page :) might be a bit tooooo cheesy but in case the lil one ever needs someone to pick them up from the airport press the button. i've added it in case you don't want to text me, but still want someone to pick you up from the airport cause i will gladly do it anytime

don't worry if you accidentally press it! there's gonna be a 2nd lil window that comes up asking for the flight number, optionally of course cause you can always text me later. i’m deep down hoping you press it when you come back to sf next sunday hehe so the button will always be there in case you ever need someone to pick you up

i also slightlyyyy cleaned up the last page, i have a couple things i want to add to the last page aka remove that big block of text and replace with something else

okiiiii that's the daily site update! hehe i love the lil updates

it is currently 6:26pm and i just wrapped up work. i went to the local convenience store to grab a 12 whiteclaw pack so i'm going thru my first one. pregaming by myself isn't the funnest experience but i'm kinda excited to go to wobblelands now

plan is to get there at 8pm so i got about an hour to leave aka finish this, shower, get ready and peace out

unfortunately i got paged today at 5am so i only got a total of 4 hours of sleep... not ideal but at least on call is kinda over

only got 15k steps during work but hoping to get another 10k steps while i go on side quests

okiiii that's it for now i need to go shower and then upload a pic in about an hour. i'll update this date tmrw morning to talk about my experience

ok bye for now

its 723 and this is my pregame station! 1 more whiteclaw am im out

hiiiii this is next day and it is 1030am 

im still in bed soooo eepy so i'll prob nap for a bit more after i type this one

not gonna lie yesterday was suuuch a vibe i think it is cause of the VIP ticket. the line was soooo long i think some people said it took 1-2 hrs to get in

for me it took 1 minute :)

first thing i did when i got in was go straight to the merch store... i was already drunk and the place was PACKED

I ended up getting a couple things, one for the tiny one obviously. it was around 8pm and i think there was 4 more headliners to go thru. i bought a tiny white claw ($14 jesus christ) and did some side questing and walked around

i walked to a VIP area which had a bunch of really cute seating and a bar. there was no line to the bar and the bartenders were SOOO friendly like genuinely it made my night. i was kinda done with my first white claw and i figured i'll try something else

they got me a beat box for a discounted price and they also saw me carrying the merch so they insisted they hold it for me they were so sweet

there is also a private bathroom with no line and it was clean. the lines outside of this area was sooo long especially for girls prob a 30mins wait time

i took a lil selfie of me at the vip section ok but like i was already drunk so pls ignore

i also ended up getting a hotdog to go with my beatbox... i never had a beatbox that shiet is bomb. i think it was selling for $19 and i had no idea it was 12%. that box will fk you up so much harder than a whiteclaw so the value is there

i didnt end up going to the floor even tho vip had a lil section pretty close to the DJ i ended up just hanging up on the 2nd floor similar to dreamstate. by the end of the night the whole 2nd floor was packed not a single seat free around the center

overall i enjoyed the experience not my type of music but the people vibe people were bringing made it up. i was also really drunk by the end of the night and left about 45 mins before the end cause i didnt want to deal with the crowd. the closing headliner aka woolie was such a vibe

people in the stands were really sweet but i heard people on the floor is not a vibe cause of ppl pushing around and stuff for this type of music. ppl up top were just having fun and also lit AF lol

so heres a few pictures from last night. i think the tiny one wouldve enjoyed at least the VIP experience. 

ive ended up buying another VIP ticket right now so going for round 2! aiming for 8pm again but not gonna drink as much

im still so tired so gonna take another nap

today i optimized the first screen on mobile cause it was absolutely killing my old phone and things were slow so i added an other lil animation that looks better it kinda just feels smoother now. I also removed the flower blooming on mobile but kept it on desktop cause i still like the vibe there. i've also made so the date above can scroll to the right so alllll the dates can fit as the numbers go up up UP

today was kinda uneventful as usual during my on call weeks. I got paged 2 times this morning so thats pretty good not too disruptive and gave me some time to breathe. also got some good progress thru my on call queue and pretty proud of myself

for lunch i ordered chipotle and they had a deal where when you order $25 they give you a free $16 quesediila. so to get to $25 i got 1 bowl and stuffed it with guac the new honey chicken (extra cost) and then did double protein it was basically a protein bomb

my chipotle bowl ended up being $26 which is wild but got a free meal for tomorrow :) so i guess that evens it out. gotta enjoy my last couple days of ordering out before im back to eating homemade food. I really want to make those pizza wraps again but im missing my lil helper to wrap them up so might have to skip that one

it is currently 11:06 and i wrapped up work about an hour ago. I am back on the treadmill as i am typing this out getting my final steps in. it is soooo hot in sf even in south san francisco and im refusing to turn on the AC. so I am currently in my undies and shirtless as im walking and typing not the most glamorous but it works. I also got a tiny white claw as my first drink of the week cause im tired and deserve it like a treat

i did reallyyyy good with my steps today which is why it is my picture of the day gotta flex the numbers. also nothing else happened today so imma take the picture after im done typing this out

even while im in my undies im still so sweaty so i need to take a shower later maybe throw in a cold rinse. pooping has gotten better i pooped only twice and it was solid logs. but my booty crack is sore and it hurts i think from too much wiping and then walking for like 8 hours today which is not good not good

i was looking what to do this weekend and i saw illenium tickets were only $60 because everyone is going to wobbleland.  lucky me i managed to snag today a vip ticket to wobbleland friday for less than retail price of a GA ticket which is wild. im glad i got a vip ticket cause the line was so long for dreamstate and i think if i went by myself and stood in line for like 30 mins alone would make me sad and depressi

so having VIP also allows me to skip that line. I think imma wear the anyma hoodie hehe as usual it's becoming my rave fit. but i'll go to the merch section and get a couple things if there is a merch section. im glad im going out cause i think ive stared at my laptop for around 55 hours these past 4 days so prob gonna be 65 hours by the end of tmrw which is a bit much

i dont think i will enjoy wobbleland too much but anything to get out at this point i think even loud music sounds better than a page. i just hope i dont get paged while im there cause theres no way im answering not even gonna try

i think for tomorrows daily update it'll be a 2 parter. i'll put my thoughts down before i leave and then i'll update with my experience the next morning with some pictures like a before and after

i still feel like i got so many chores to do around my apartment but i thinks thats for sunday hopefully i can push it all to then. so much laundry to fold havent washed my sheets in a couple weeks or maybe even more and my fridge is messy like leftover city

anyways i'm always thinking how the tiny one is doing and if shes having fun i hope she's okay and sleeping well

i dont remember if i mentioned in my previous days but i made a call to a adoption center and asked if they have any kittens to foster. they said they'll call me back monday and ask me to come by maybe i'll get to meet some of the baby ones

they said you gotta foster for around 4 weeks for a kitten but everything is provided so i might do that for lil bit i feel like it'd be good for my heart

i think that is it for today i might spend another 10 mins adding something new to this site probably something small but i need to shower first cause my undies are soaked and i feel nasty . i also only took a couple sips of this whiteclaw so i need to down it brb

ok white is in my belly and my belly is happy

once again i am back in bed it is now 11:30pm as i am starting to write

today was actually kind of a vibe. the meeting i was stressin yesterday i absolutely nailed that shiet i even surprised my self. i took 5 hours this morning and ignored my on call duties to prep up for this 1 hr meeting and daaaaamn i had to take a shower right after cause i was sweaty ety. that really just go that well

to celebrate i got sushi for lunch across the street and 2 orders of edamame cause why not. felt like i earned a lil treat

luckily on call today was really easy! not a single page and not too many requests so i still managed to finish work at 6 :)

i ended up eating the 2nd subway sandwich from yesterday and snacked on the leftover edamame. not the fanciest dinner but honestly it hit the spot. after that i decided to buy new shoes to replace the ones that i wore to death and found a really good deal on saks. it was 50% off and i also have $50 credit that comes from my credit card so i got them for $100 when they retail for like $300. i am happy potato. i keep looking at the order confirmation like yesssss good purchase good job brain

theres also prime day and lots of deals right now so my inner consumerism is coming out but i didn't buy anything. i was hovering over the buy button for more philips hue lights aka the colorful lights i have around my place that make everything feel cozy

after eating buying shoes and browsing amazon i ended up gaming for a couple hours with my friends instead of going to see how to train your dragon. the lineup for movies is SOOOO loaded right now with jurassic world, superman, f1 and how to train your dragon. i kinda wanna dedicate a whole day at the movies and binge watch a few back to back. maybe in the fancy theater where i can stuff myself with food and drinks all day and not think about anything else

but i know i won't cause i want to watch with the tiny one cause i miss the tiny one way too much and its not the same without the lil one. the empty seat next to me will feel no bueno. i think having free time today and not having my brain be overloaded with work i started to overthink and it wasnt good. i just miss way too much

anyways today i actually managed to get to 20k steps. so tomorrow for sure for sure ill hit 30k steps. still haven't hit the gym these past couple weeks but that's probably for next week. it is definitely helping me mentally and physically so i'll keep going at it. my fatass also needs to lose weight so sunday i'm going to target and starting to meal prep again. maybe even bring back the salmon rice bowl era

i think that is it for today, nothing else is coming to my mind ohhh wait i didnt brush my teeth yet so ill do that and then go to sleep.

also i didnt make any changes to this website today but i'll try to update it a bit more tomorrow

        text: `another day another minor cleanup of this site. this time i did a minor changes visually, nothing too flashy, but improved the performance on mobile which felt kinda nice, actually. i kinda enjoy cleaning up a website, it's weirdly satisfying in a way that's hard to explain. haven't done that since year 1 of learning how to code, back when i'd obsess over every tiny pixel shift like it actually mattered, little by little it feels more like a real space

i think today i'll keep it a bit short, i just wrapped up work, it's 930pm, and honestly my brain and eyes are completely fried. im about to take a shower, then watch tv for an hour before crashing. i have an important customer meeting tmrw and im not prepared at all, haven't even looked at the deck, haven't even thought about it really, so im prob gonna wake up at 6ish am and scramble to prep for it.

today, as usual, work sucked. this time i got paged 18 times starting at 6am. as soon as banks opened on the east coast, everything just instantly went to shiet, so i had to jump on a few calls, and patch stuff together on the fly.

i really wanted to watch how to train your dragon today, kinda had my heart set on it all day, but unfortunately got wrapped up with work. and i also totally forgot today is tuesday aka the day i have to release a bunch of things to production and keep a close eye on everything in case it all goes sideways, which it usually does, because of course it does

i did actually end up walking 10k steps tho, which was better than nothing. not the 30k steps i wanted, not even close, but i'll take any progress at this point. i'm trying not to be too hard on myself. maybe i'll try again tomorrow if things are chill… or at least less chaotic than today.

my pooping was actually worse today i don't know whats going on. i straight up went to the bathroom 6 or 7 times today, i honestly lost count at some point. its really not good

otherwise not much else happened. i ended up grabbing dinner, aka subway 2 for 1 deal, so i got another sammich for tomorrow :) a small win

ohhhh and also i found a new food truck a block away! haven't tried it yet but it looked kinda promising. so down to check it out sometime soon.

i also need to figure out plans for this weekend. i saw wobbleland was this weekend and apparently it's like hard style edm, which im not a huge fan of to be honest, but im still down to try it out. it's at cow palace so i can maybe go on side quests and then chill on the top floor, similar to dreamstates. i'll figure it out later cause i also think i'm gonna be really tired by friday and might just want to rot instead

anyways today i have 2 pictures!

i am all cozied up in bed now after a rough work day. windows open and it be reallyyyyy cold but im under my blankies butt ass naked so im in a happy state. just ate some mcdonalds which is not good not good, but also kind of soul-healing

i think i am addicted to mcdonalds burgers i switched it up from eating subways. i really got to start getting my steps in tommorrow so tmrw my goal is 30k steps no jokes

anyways i think today im doing better mentally... definitely not better physically. I had to poop 4 times today and the pooping seshs were not looking good - i think it is the mcdonalds diet. im kinda getting hungry now so i might get a burrito from the food truck but im also butt ass naked and putting clothes on might be a bit too much effort. internal conflict is very real

work day kinda sucked today tho, i was paged 11 times throughout the day which isnt unheard of but not a fun experience. also the guy who was on call last week did not wrap up all the on work tasks so when i woke up i already had a bunch on my plate

for lunch i had greek food aka nick the greek wraps they had a 2 for 1 deal. they are really fire i had to ask for no fries in the wraps cause i feel they ruin the wrap. for dinner i had 2 double cheese burgers from mcdonalds. starting tomorrow im going back on the health grind... maybe

i've also redesigned this page a bit during a 30 mins call. im actually proud on how this page turned out to look like feels like im a professional UI designer. i'll prob clean it up a bit more after i have my 5th poop of the day tonight

other than working for 14 hours today, i also did alllll my laundry took 4 whole loads. i also cleaned up a lafufu by hand using a gentle soap. i think the lafufu turned out pretty well, smells good too. fresh laundry and clean lafufu equals peak serotonin

also while browsing tik tok during my 4th poop of the day i got a lot of clips of saturdays block party. apparently audien was such a vibe which makes me sad i missed it. alan walker was also vibe at the end where i missed it as well. fomo is not good

side thought => while working on this lil daily thoughts page i had a few fun ideas i'll prob add in in a few days when my on call days isnt too loaded - it'll be fun i think. my one brain cell having a mini creative spark

so yaaaa today was kinda uneventful the picture of the day is just my love sac filled with clean laundry and a clean lafufu. just wholesome

i really want to watch how to train your dragon so if tomorrow im not overwhelmed with on call, im thinking of going and grabbing chipotle, sneaking in a couple drinks and watching the movie alone. im thinking of doing more solo dates to get out of my house more often. sounds kinda healing tbh

at the same time my friends asked if i was free to game for a few hours tomorrow. i really wanna but same time i dont want to stare at my computer any longer, todays work sesh killed me

okiiiii i think thats it for tonight! im ready to pass out

also the last page is a little messed up on both mobile and desktop imma clean that up at some points

i think i need to automate how this picture upload works. rn i download a picture from my photos album, then i need to manually convert to .jpg and downsize for a smaller size - imma fix this at some point

I figured this will be my spot to journal and end my days writing

instead of laying in bed on my phone, instead i'll just write for a bit and just voice my thoughts where i talk to myself in a way

i haven't really decided on how i will design this page but i've spent about 10 minutes on this design so that'll do for day numero uno

where do i start where do i start -- these past couple days i haven't been feeling well
even tho this is a long holiday aka july 4th where people celebrate together with friends and family i felt pretty alone

I usually celebrated canada day which was on monday, and previously celebrated july 4th with my bro, but i havent seen him or my nephews in over a month. mostly because he was travelling and i kinda closed myself off which is not good

i was also supposed to hang out with a couple who invited me for food, but i never made it. i sent money to them via venmo to help them out with the food and drinks but they refunded me early this morning with a not so happy message which made me wake up in a sad state. not only was i late to theyre last hosting by a couple hours, i fully missed this one -- not sure if they'll invite me again at this point oops

yesterday i also went to a block party, never again am i going to one of those alone. block parties are for sure a thing you go as a group -- lesson learned

anyways today wasnt any better. it is 1am right now and i am dreading this upcoming week. i'm so tired and im on call which makes things even harder

the whole plan for today was to clean my apartment to bring it to a state where i feel a bit happy walking around while im dealing with work but i made no progress today

this is my picture of the day -- i ended up ordering chipotle and watching a movie about tetris while my feetsies are in the pocketsies. movie ended up a lot more dramatic than i expected but i at least i felt a bit happy and made me forget about all the work stuff i gotta do next week. Wish i couldve gamed with my friends instead but they were all busy

i was a bit sleepy before i started writing this but i kinda woke myself up. i need to wake up at 630 am for my on call shift so i pretty much have to force myself to sleep

this be day 1 of my thoughts and i'll improve on how i continue with this

oh and also i improved how this looks like on a phone, the copy is not cutoff anymore! and the text takes more space on the page
but i think i might've broken something on the desktop version :( i'll have to fix it later

peace`,

                    <p><strong>First and most important, I am so deeply sorry for the pain I caused you by betraying your trust.</strong> There's no excuse for what I did. You didn't deserve that, not even for a second.
                    You've been the only person on my mind every single day, and even with all my flaws, I always tried to show up for you and be there however I could.
                    I know I broke something precious between us, and I just want you to know how much I regret it, and how much I still love you.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="love-declaration">
                    <p><em>I love you so much it is almost ridiculous.</em> I have never felt so comfortable with someone so quickly. Being around you feels so natural and I can spend every day with you and be completely myself. I miss you so so much already. And I hope to see you again soon.</p>

                    <div class="love-reason">
                        <p><strong>You make it so easy to be myself</strong></p>
                        <p>With you, I never have to pretend. I can be goofy, anxious, tired, over the top, or completely quiet and you never made me feel like I was too much. You saw all the versions of me and somehow you still stayed. That kind of safety and acceptance is something I've never felt with anyone else.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="love-reason">
                        <p><strong>You turn the simplest moments into core memories</strong></p>
                        <p>Whether we're just yapping for hours, watching something dumb, or walking somewhere without a plan, you make it feel meaningful. You somehow turn every day into comfort and even silence into warmth. Life feels softer with you in it.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="love-reason">
                        <p><strong>You challenge me to be better</strong></p>
                        <p>You're not afraid to speak your mind, especially when it comes to feelings, and I needed that. You've called me out when I was emotionally closed off, but never in a way that made me shut down. You make me want to grow, not just for you but for myself too. That's rare and it means everything.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="love-reason">
                        <p><strong>You love people in such a beautiful way</strong></p>
                        <p>The way you care about your friends and your family is genuine and full of heart. You check in, you listen, you show up. And the love they have for you in return says so much. Watching how you treat the people you care about has only made me admire you more. Your heart is huge and it's real.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>You're the person I pictured building a life with</strong></p>
                        <p>I saw it all. Waking up next to you, figuring out groceries and bills, planning trips, laughing in the kitchen. I never imagined that kind of future with anyone else. With you it felt so real, so right, like home.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>You saw my worst and stayed anyway</strong></p>
                        <p>When you found out about the whole DUI situation, I honestly expected things to shift, for you to see me differently or pull away. But you didn't. You still treated me with the same warmth and care, like that part of my past didn't erase the rest of me. That kind of quiet acceptance hit deep. Being around you felt safe, not because you overlooked it, but because you saw it and stayed anyway</p>

                    <p>All the little habits we have like me feeding you, tiny one eeping till noon on a work day and walking thru my hallway butt ass naked with the eepy eyes checking up on me.</p>
                    
                    <p>Even now, when I walk through my apartment and there's always a reminder of you, it's like you're there with me for a second.</p>
                    
                    <p>I especially miss the late night facetime calls where I had to wait for you to pass out on me. I have too many screen shots of this one sleeping on me at 4am on a Monday</p>
                    <p>Every night this past week I was hopping you'd call me so we can talk about nothing and everything at the same time</p>
                    <p><em>You turned ordinary days into something special. You were my home in a world that never slowed down. And every silly, sweet, beautiful little moment with you meant the world to me.</em></p>

Or just meet you up from yours :). Then we can grab lunch, maybe wander through a museum, share dinner, watch a movie or a show, and make the whole day about us. ✨</p>

                                <p>The idea was to drop this off Monday morning with a bottle of champagne and some orange juice and be like, have a mimosa while you're reading and watching all of this. But you said you won't be here Monday morning.</p>
